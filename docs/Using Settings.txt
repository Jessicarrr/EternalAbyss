If you want to add a new setting to the existing categories using an existing setting type
	You can add new settings to the game easily by editing the files in:
	res://utility/settings/categories/...
	and select one of the categories (accessibility, graphics, audio, etc)
	Currently it accepts:
	- slider number range settings (select a number between x and y)
	- checkbox setting (boolean)
	- multiple choice setting (e.g. high, medium, low) basically a series of strings to choose from

If you need to add a new type of setting:
	1. add new type that extends base_setting in:
		res://utility/settings/types/...
	2. add the setting to one of the categories in:
		res://utility/settings/categories/...
	3. add a new UI widget to represent the setting. Extend Widget. located in:
		res://ui/settings_menu/scripts/widgets/...
	3.5 Make sure the set_value changes the UI widget appropriately so that the game
		itself can change the ui to represent the back-end
	4. add the widget to be loaded automatically in the settings ui via:
		ui/settings_menu/scripts/base_settings_loader.gd
	this can be done by adding to the prefabs array.

If you need to add a new category of setting:
	1. Go to:
		res://utility/settings/categories
	2. Add a new category extending SettingsCategory
	3. Add relevant settings variables to the category.
	4. Don't forget to define _init() to name the category properly
		(use other categories as a reference)
	5. Go to:
		res://utility/settings/settings_manager.gd
	6. Make sure you call new() on your category inside settings manager so it's added
		to the game.
