Ghost Enemy Design Summary:

1. Appearance and Presence:

    Invisible or barely visible under normal conditions.
    Subtle visual cues when near, like a faint shimmer or distortion in the air.
    Occasionally interacts with the environment (e.g., objects move slightly, temperature drops).

2. Detection Mechanism:

    Senses based on noise and proximity.
    Reacts to disturbances in the environment (e.g., running, knocking over objects).
    Provides subtle audio-visual feedback when players are close to alerting it.

3. Behavior:

    Generally passive until provoked by close proximity or loud noises.
    Once alerted, it becomes more visible and aggressive.
    May have patterns or patrol areas where it's more sensitive to disturbances.

4. Attack and Interaction:

    Attacks can vary from physical manifestations to inducing fear or confusion in the player (e.g., blurring vision, creating illusions).
    Contact with the ghost might drain player resources like health or stamina.

5. Weaknesses and Countermeasures:

    Certain items or light sources may repel or reveal the ghost temporarily.
    Could be vulnerable to specific types of attacks or magic.

6. Special Abilities:

    Phasing through walls or appearing suddenly to surprise the player.
    Possibly affecting the player's sanity or perception.

7. Defeat and Rewards:

    Upon defeat, it might provide resources, lore, or access to previously blocked areas.
    The method of defeat might require more than simple combat, involving puzzles or special items.

8. Variations:

    Different types of ghosts with varying levels of aggression, speed, and detection abilities.
    Some might mimic voices, create cold spots, or have other unique haunting characteristics.

9. Narrative and Lore:

    Backstory explaining the ghost's presence and nature.
    Might be tied to specific locations or events within the game's story.
