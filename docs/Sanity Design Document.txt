# Sanity System Design Document

## Overview
The Sanity System introduces a psychological layer to the game, affecting the player's perception
 and interaction with the environment. As an optional feature, it offers a more intense and
 rewarding experience for those seeking added depth and challenge.

## Basic Mechanics:
1. **Optional Difficulty:** Players can choose to enable the Sanity Mechanics at the start for increased
 rewards. Playing with sanity enabled results in higher currency gains.
2. **Environmental Effects:** Staying in the dark too long, or standing near enemies, 
reduces sanity.
3. **Sanity Meter:** A float value ranging from 100 (fully sane) to 0 (completely insane).
 The player's actions and environment will influence this value.
4. **Lighting Mechanisms:** Players can interact with environmental light sources, turning them on
 or off. Additionally, players can carry a torch in their off-hand, which provides light but can
 go out or get destroyed.
5. **Visual and Audio Distortions:** As sanity decreases, the player experiences more intense visual
 distortions (e.g., distorted screen) and audio hallucinations, affecting gameplay and immersion.
6. **Sanity Restoration:** Define methods for players to regain sanity, such as finding safe zones,
 staying in the light, completing objectives, or eating and drinking.

## Optional Features for Enhanced Horror
1. **Unique Visual Hallucinations:** The environment subtly shifting or decaying via screen
 distortion effect
2. **Hallucinatory Entities:** Introduce creatures or objects that aren't there, or make real ones
 appear distorted and more terrifying.
3. **Psychological Narrative:** Incorporate elements of the player's backstory or fears into
 hallucinations, adding a personal and emotional layer to the experience.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Develop Sanity Meter UI:** Create a visual representation of the player's current sanity level.
2. **Design Visual and Audio Distortions:** Make shader for decreasing sanity and low sanity.
 Make losing sanity sound.
3. **Script Environmental Interactions:** Program how darkness and disturbing sights affect sanity.
4. **Create Recovery Mechanisms:** Implement ways for players to regain sanity through actions
 and achievements.
5. **Playtest and Balance:** Continuously test and adjust the impact of sanity on gameplay to find
 the right balance between challenge and enjoyment.

## Additional Considerations
- **Player Feedback:** Provide clear feedback on what actions or events affect sanity, so players
 can learn and adapt their strategies.
- **Difficulty Scaling:** Consider how sanity impacts different difficulty levels and adjust the
 rate of decline and recovery accordingly.
- **Narrative Integration:** Weave the sanity mechanics into the game's story and world for a more
 cohesive and immersive experience.

The sanity system aims to add depth, challenge, and horror to the game, making each playthrough a 
unique and potentially unsettling experience. By carefully balancing the mechanics and continuously 
iterating based on player feedback, the Sanity System can become a defining feature of the game.
